Playground Series - Kaggle (Season 5, Episode 2)
This repository contains my work for the Playground Series on Kaggle, specifically Season 5, Episode 2. The project explores the dataset using Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and visualization.
Input Data
- The dataset provided in the Kaggle Playground Series.
- Features processed using t-SNE for visualization.
- Quantum Neural Networks applied for predictive modeling.
  
Output

- Model performance metrics from QNN.
- Insights and analysis derived from the dataset.
Feel free to check out the code and contribute!
